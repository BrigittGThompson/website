    <h1>You're a person.</h1>
    <p>
      You are a person—a real person—not a to do list, not a widget, not a machine. You are not your resume, your job title, or your bank balance. You're a person. You have things to do, but you are not those things. You are the one doing the things.
    </p>
    <p>
      When you place your attention on the body, and notice in-the-moment, physical sensation, you become more present. You bring awareness to your life and work. This is called embodiment.

      My name is Brigitt Thompson. I'm a writer, teacher, and coach. I explore embodiment and invite people to do simple practices that remind them that they are human.
